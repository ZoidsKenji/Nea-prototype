# NEA Prototype

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Please note that **this is just a PROTOTYPE**, aka modeling, for my A-Level NEA project, and it is **NOT** the final NEA project. I will upload the final work to another GitHub repository.

## Describtion

This is my A-Level NEA prototype (modeling), and this is a car game 
The game is a motorway racing game where there is an infinitely long motorway with traffic. You and your opponent will race through traffic and if the last place is too far away from the first place, then they will constantly lose health. And there will be police chasing as well, which will try to stop you by crashing into you and your opponent. When you crash into traffic or collide with anything such as police car or opponent you will also lose health, and the last one survive wins. The opponent will be control either by an AI or online player as it must face different situations and as the further you go the traffic became denser. For the last place you will be randomly given a skills like health regenerationâ€¦

> [!NOTE]  
> These are just the idea of the game, so a lot of the stuff I've mentioned has not been made. So that will be what my final NEA project will look like.
